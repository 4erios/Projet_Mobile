  dialogueDepart: You really befriend those guys ? This old man maybe seems like
    an ordinary worker, but I can promise he's not.

    people while working.
  reponseAffection: Come on. Don't tell me you don't know that he killed his mother
    while working ? An that she wasn't the only victim.

    he killed with this work accident ?
