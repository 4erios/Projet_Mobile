  dialogueDepart: 'Tonight wine was delicious!  My business did pretty well this
    month, so I think I''ll celebrate it again tomorrow. What a strange animal. A
    new breed maybe? Come here little one, come here. '
  reponseInteret: 'Hey! Don''t be like this. I can give you food. And if you''re
    a special breed of... cat? Maybe I''ll give you to my wife. She didn''t like
    the ones in the pet shop. '
  reponseAffection: 'Hmmm.. It''s pretty affectionate. Next time I''ll show you to
    my wife, maybe she''ll like you. '
  reponseCompassion: 'What''s this, you''re... crying? Hmm, your species is pretty
    interesting, here take this treat. I''ll see you next time! '
  reponseDegout: 'Beurk! You''re just a really ugly thing. Don''t get near me I might
    get sick. '
  reponsePeur: 'Argh! What are you doing? Do you even know who I am? Get away from
    me! Do you hear me? GET OFF! '
  reponseHaine: Tsss! And here I thought I could find a gift for my wife...
