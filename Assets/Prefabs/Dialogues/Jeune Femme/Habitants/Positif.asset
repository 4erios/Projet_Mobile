  dialogueDepart: As the night begins to fall, you get out of the sewers. It's been
    a while since you used this exit, so you don't know if there's anyone around.
    As you look around, you hear some familiar footsteps... "There you are! The strange
    animal! I was searching for you! I told them it was not my imagination!"
  reponseInteret: 'Oh? Do you like me? I''m really curious about what you are you
    know? Maybe next time I''ll bring a vet here! '
  reponseAffection: I understand now! That's your way of acting cute right? Well
    you're lucky I brought some treats. Here, take some.
  reponseCompassion: 'Ooooh, poor little thing. Here are some snacks, so don''t be
    sad ok? My children often play around here so if you meet them you should be
    nice. You''ll be less lonely afterward! '
  reponseDegout: 'Ah! And here I thought you were a nice one. Don''t bite me, I don''t
    want to catch whatever sickness you bear! '
  reponsePeur: 'Kyaaaa! Help! This thing bit me! Officer! There''s a dangerous animal
    over there! '
  reponseHaine: And here I thought I could show you to a scientist and get some easy
    money. Or at least get my kids a pet since I can't afford one... Next time I'll
    catch you!!
